# **App Name**: Dynamic Persona

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Head Display: Display a central head silhouette dynamically assembled from animated symbols.
- Animated Assembly: Use GSAP or Framer Motion for assembling animation on page load or scroll trigger.
- Head Animation: Implement subtle breathing and head movement animations once assembled. Animate the characters to ripple, pulse, or shift, driven by a tool that ensures a digital/matrix effect.
- Interactive Elements: Create hover and tap effects to change text (Brazilian Portuguese samples: “Explorando Novos Limites”, “Inovação em cada detalhe”).

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Pure black (#000000) to create a stark, minimal backdrop.
- Primary color: Off-white/light gray (#E0E0E0) for the animated symbols to provide contrast.
- Accent color: Faint neon blue (#64B5F6) used sparingly for depth or highlight on specific elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for its retro-tech, modern aesthetic, and is suitable for short lines of text such as those on display here.
- Orchestrate animations using GSAP or Framer Motion for a smooth, organic feel.
- Center the animated head silhouette to act as the centerpiece of the section. Use negative space to ensure the form is clearly defined.
